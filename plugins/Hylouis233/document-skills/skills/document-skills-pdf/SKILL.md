description: Create, extract, transform, or analyze PDF documents. Use this Skill whenever a .pdf file is the input or output - generating reports, one-pagers, posters or structured documents as real selectable-text PDFs; extracting text, tables or images from existing PDFs; merging, splitting, rotating, or watermarking pages; filling forms; checking that a produced PDF has the right page count and extractable text.

# PDF workbench

PDF tasks fail when the agent mixes incompatible libraries or generates pages as screenshots.
Route by job, use one tool per job, verify the artifact.

## Step 0 - Check the toolchain

```bash
python -c "import reportlab, pypdf, fitz; print('reportlab', reportlab.Version, '| pypdf ok | pymupdf ok')"
```

- `reportlab` - creation (preferred: selectable text, controlled layout).
- `pypdf` - page-level transforms: split, merge, rotate, encrypt, form fields.
- `pymupdf` (`fitz`) - extraction (text with coordinates, tables, images), rasterization,
  page-level inspection.

Missing any -> say so and degrade to the ones present; do not substitute screenshot pipelines.

## Step 1 - Pick exactly one tool for the job

| Task | Tool | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Build a new structured PDF (report, one-pager, letter, checklist) | ReportLab | [references/create.md](references/create.md) |
| Extract text / tables / images | PyMuPDF | [references/extract.md](references/extract.md) |
| Merge, split, rotate, watermark, encrypt, forms | pypdf | [references/transform.md](references/transform.md) |
| Inspect: page count, sizes, fonts, links, blank-page detection | PyMuPDF | [references/inspect.md](references/inspect.md) |

Chaining tools on one artifact is fine (create -> inspect). Using two creation libraries on one
file is not.

## Step 2 - Shared rules

1. **Text-first**: a generated PDF must contain extractable text. Image-of-text is acceptable
   only when the user asked for a rasterized look or provides only images.
2. **Page geometry is explicit**: A4 = 595.27 x 841.89 pt, US Letter = 612 x 792 pt. Declare
   the target size and margins up front; re-check fit after generation.
3. **Fonts**: the standard 14 fonts cover only limited encodings; they do not automatically
   support arbitrary Unicode. Check that the selected face contains every requested character.
   If any glyph is unsupported - including CJK, Cyrillic, Arabic, Devanagari, or emoji - embed
   one or more licensed TTF/OTF fonts with the required coverage and use them for those runs.
   If no suitable embeddable font is available, report the limitation instead of emitting tofu.
4. **Overflow is a defect**: content that spills past the last page or the margin must be
   detected in postcheck and fixed (shrink, paginate, or cut), never shipped.
5. Write output to a new path; keep inputs untouched unless in-place was requested.
6. **Accessibility claims require tagged output.** ReportLab does not produce a tagged PDF/UA
   document, so do not describe ordinary ReportLab output as accessible or screen-reader-ready.
   When PDF/UA or assistive-technology compatibility is required, use a toolchain that can create
   and validate tags, reading order, structure roles, language, and alternative text. If that
   toolchain is unavailable, stop and report the limitation; offer an accessible DOCX or HTML
   deliverable instead of silently returning an untagged PDF.

## Step 3 - Postcheck (mandatory)

```python
import os
import fitz
import pypdf

output_path = "output.pdf"
expected_page_count = 1  # set this from the task; do not derive it from the output
password = os.environ.get("PDF_PASSWORD")

Confirm: page count matches the request; every page except those explicitly listed in
`intentionally_raster_only_pages` has extractable text or at least one form widget (a pure
interactive page); each requested key string is listed in `expected_strings_by_page` and
extracts on the correct page; every value in `page_sizes` is the declared size within
`page_size_tolerance`; and no page's text, image placements, or vector drawings extend past
the page box (the overflow check). Report all five. For pixel-sensitive work, render every applicable page
with PyMuPDF at 100 dpi and check that each render is non-blank (mean pixel value).
