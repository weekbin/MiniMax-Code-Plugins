/**
 * Redaction and bounding for content that may leave the local process.
 *
 * The Studio serves to 127.0.0.1 only, but tool arguments and results routinely
 * carry credentials, and the MCP surface hands payloads to a model whose context
 * leaves the machine. Every `full` payload is therefore scrubbed and bounded
 * before it is returned over MCP or written into the HTML page.
 *
 * Four properties matter more than cleverness here:
 *
 *   **Order.** Rules run most-specific first. An `Authorization: Bearer …` header
 *   has to be consumed as a whole, because a generic key/value rule would eat the
 *   header name and leave the token with nothing to anchor the scheme match —
 *   which is exactly how an earlier revision emitted `Authorization=[redacted]
 *   <token>` with the token intact.
 *
 *   **Shape.** A redaction preserves the surrounding syntax, so the result stays
 *   valid JSON and the payload a reader needs survives. Replacing everything with
 *   `[redacted]` would be safer and useless.
 *
 *   **Tier A before tier B.** The runtime stores tool results as JSON *text*, not
 *   as objects, so the credential in a tool result arrives as
 *   `{\"api_key\":\"…\"}` — a JSON document inside a JSON string. Two independent
 *   passes cover that: a structured walk of any string value that parses as JSON
 *   (tier A), and an escape-aware key/value rule that tolerates backslash-escaped
 *   delimiters (tier B). Neither alone is enough — tier A needs a well-formed
 *   document, tier B needs only the shape — and an earlier revision had neither,
 *   so a credential in a tool result crossed the wire unredacted.
 *
 *   **Idempotence.** Applying the set twice equals applying it once. Text is
 *   redacted at the data source and swept again at the egress boundary, and a
 *   second pass must not corrupt the first one's output. Every rule, the
 *   truncation marker and the path folding are written to satisfy this, and
 *   `test/redact.test.mjs` asserts it over the whole corpus rather than by
 *   inspection.
 *
 * What this cannot do is stated in README under "隐私": it recognises credential
 * *shapes* and credential-named *keys*, so an unlabelled high-entropy string is not
 * a credential to it, and a workspace path outside the folded roots is returned
 * verbatim. Those are documented limits, not oversights.
